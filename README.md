My fun realization of reddit.

### Frontend side.  
On client side i chose nextjs for practicing SSR and styled-components for styling.  
Also on frontend side im using graphql for local state and data fetching.  

### Server side.  
On server side im using typegraphql + typescript, because with this technologies it is easy and fast to create Graphql API.  
For auth i chose node-sessions + redis as sessions storage.  

### Install project.  
Client: `cd client && yarn`  
Server: `cd server && yarn`
